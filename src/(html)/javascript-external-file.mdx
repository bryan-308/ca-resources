## External JavaScript File

We can create external JavaScript file and embed it in many html page. It provides code re-usability because single JavaScript file can be used in several html pages. An external JavaScript file must be saved by `.js` extension containing your JavaScript code and then link to it from your HTML file using the `<script>` tag with the src attribute.



Let's create an example of external JavaScript file that prints **Hello World** in an alert dialog box. Save it as `script.js`.

```js
function showMessage() {
  alert("Hello, World!");
}
```

In this file, we are defining a simple JavaScript function called **showMessage** that displays an alert with the message "**Hello, World!**".

Now let's include the JavaScript file into HTML page. It calls the JavaScript function on button click.

```html {11} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>External JavaScript File</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>External JavaScript Example</h1>
    <button type="button" onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

    <!-- Link to the external JavaScript file -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
