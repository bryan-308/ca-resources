| `onclick`     | Get activated when the element in **clicked**. This is often used to act, like submitting a form or opening up a dialog.                                                                                                                              |
| `onmouseover` | It activates when the mouse pointer is **moved onto an element**. It is used to change the style of any element, like highlighting a button on mouse over.                                                                                            |
| `onmouseout`  | Triggers when the mouse pointer is **moved away from an element**. This is for changing styles back or hiding elements that were displayed on a onmouseover.                                                                                          |
| `onchange`    | It triggers when we **change value of any input element**. We often use this with an **input field** a **select menu** or **text area** to takes some action when the user changes content value.                                                     |
| `onkeydown`   | Fires when a **key is pressed down**. This is a mechanism for **keyboard shortcuts** or **validating input** as the user types.                                                                                                                       |
| `onkeyup`     | It activates when **key is released**. Usually used in conjunction with onkeydown, which occurs throughout pressing a key down.                                                                                                                       |
| `onload`      | Triggers once the element (usually an image or whole page) has **completed loading**. This commonly used for **initializing scripts** or the **execution of actions** that should only run after the entire content has been loaded (like a redirect).|
| `onfocus`     | You can use **onfocus** to do something special when **a control gains focus**. For example, when the user clicks within a text control, you could implement an onfocus event handler to make the text control’s change to blue.                      |
