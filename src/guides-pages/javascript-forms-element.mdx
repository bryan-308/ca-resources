## Forms element

Now, let's talk about the form element, which is responsible for organizing the controls on a form. 

Here’s a template for the form element’s syntax:
```plaintext
<form>
  label
  text-box, list-box, check-box, etc.
  label
  text-box, list-box, check-box, etc.
  ...
  submit-button
</form>
```

The example above is in HTML form structure that shows a basic outline of a form in HTML and is used to collect user input.

### Form Element's Short Code

The following code implements a form with two text controls and a submit button:

```HTML
<form>
  First Name:
  <input type="text" name="first" id="first" size="15" autofocus>
  <br />
  Last Name:
  <input type="text" name="last" id="last" size="15" autofocus>
  <br />
  <input type="button" value="Generate Email" onclick="generateEmail(this.form);">
</form>
```

> Take note of how the code above aligns with the previously provided template. 
>
> User entries for the first and last names are stored in the first two text controls.

Details of text control syntax will be covered later, but not quite yet. A button serves as the bottom control. The **generateEmail** method, which creates an email address by combining the entered **first** and **last** names, is called by the button's onclick event handler when it is clicked. We’ll explain the <MDXLink href="https://ca-resources.vercel.app/guides/javascript-event-handler">event handler’s form argument</MDXLink> later when we present the web page that this form is part of. But first, let’s finish talking about forms.

The `<form>` tag defines the form element, which groups input elements and buttons together, enabling data collection from the user. Within the form, the label "**First Name:**" is used to indicate that the following text input field is for entering the user's **first name**.

The input field itself is defined with `<input type="text" id="first" size="15">`. The `type="text"` attribute specifies that this input field is intended for text input. The `id="first"` attribute provides a unique identifier for the field, which can be used for JavaScript manipulation and CSS styling. The `size="15"` attribute sets the visible width of the input field to accommodate approximately **15 characters**, although this does not restrict the actual amount of text that can be entered; it merely affects the field's appearance.

The label "**Last Name:**" similarly indicates that the subsequent input field is for entering the user's last name. This field is defined with `<input type="text" id="last" size="15">`. Here, `type="text"` specifies that the field is for text input, `id="last"` assigns a unique identifier, and `size="15"` determines the visible width of the input field, allowing it to display about **15 characters**.

Finally, the `<input type= "button" value="Generate Email" onclick="generateEmail(this.form);">` defines a button that triggers a JavaScript function when clicked. The `type="button"` attribute indicates that this is a button used for **client-side** actions rather than form submission. The `value="Generate Email"` sets the text displayed on the button. The `onclick="generateEmail(this.form);"` attribute attaches an event handler that calls the **generateEmail** function when the button is clicked. The `this.form` argument passes the current form object to the function, enabling it to interact with and retrieve values from the form fields.

### Example of Web Page with Form to Input Data

Let’s create a simple web page with a form that allows users to input their **first** and **last** names, generate an email address based on the input, and display the generated email address on the page.

#### Source code for Email Address Generator web page

```HTML showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Email Address Generator</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function generateEmail(form) {
        // Generate the email address using form values
        var email = form.elements["first"].value + " " + form.elements["last"].value + "@gmail.com";

        // Set the innerHTML of the <p> element with id "email"
        document.getElementById("email").innerHTML = email;

        // Reset the form and focus on the first input
        form.reset();
        form.elements["first"].focus();
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      First Name:
      <input type="text" name="first" id="first" size="15" autofocus>
      <br />
      Last Name:
      <input type="text" name="last" id="last" size="15" autofocus>
      <br />
      <input type="button" value="Generate Email" onlcick="generateEmail(this.form);">
      <p id="email"></p>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

As shown in the code above when you run the code, the user enters their **first** and **last** names and clicks the "**Generate Email**" button, the JavaScript function **generateEmail**, creates an email address using the provided names, displays it in the `<p>` element, and resets the form. The form’s first input field is automatically focused after the reset.
