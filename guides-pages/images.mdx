### HTML Images
- In HTML, images are defined using `<img />` tag.
- The `<img />` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
- The `<img />` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

## HTML Image Attributes
- The **src** attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.
- The **alt** attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it.
- The value of the alt attribute **should describe the image**.
- It is important to take note of the file type of the image (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`).

- **Portable Network Graphics** (`.png`) newest format for images that supports multiple colors and resolutions. The PNG format is patent-free.
- **Joint Photographic Experts Group** (`.jpg`) is a graphic image saved using a lossy compression techniques that discards some data during compression process. JPEG file format supports images with many colors **(>256)**, such as photographs.
