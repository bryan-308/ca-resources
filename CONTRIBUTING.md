## Fork

### 1. Fork the Repository

Begin by visiting the [project repository](https://github.com/bryan308/ca-resources) and clicking the **Fork** button. This action creates a personal copy of the repository under your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project. For more details, refer to the [GitHub Docs on Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on your contributions in your local development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ca-resources.git
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch with a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your contribution. This helps keep your work organized and makes it easier for others to review.

```bash
git checkout -b v2/add-resource
```

-----

## File Path Where the Resources are Stored

The resources are stored in the `resources.ts` file located at:

```text
/ca-resources/data/
  â””â”€ resources.ts
```

```typescript
page: { // object key as the resource path
  title: "",
  // ...
  resourcesList: [
    {
      title: "", // Title of the resources category (optional)
      links: [
        {
          title: "", // Title of the specific link
          url: "",
          description: "",
          iconPath: "",
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Steps to Gather Resource Information

### 1. Use Desktop/Laptop

It is recommended to use a desktop or laptop for ease of gathering information by inspecting website elements. Open the website you want to add.

### 2. Gather Title

Using developer tools, inspect the websiteâ€™s `<title>` element inside the `<head>` tag and copy the text to use as the resource title.

![gather title](public/contribution-images/gather-title.png)

### 3. Get the URL

Copy the main website URL; if the webpage is a subpage, it's okay to use it as long as it directs users to the main webpage.

### 4. Get the Description

Look for the `<meta name="description" content="...">` tag in the `<head>` section. Copy the `content` attribute's value as the description.

![gather description](public/contribution-images/gather-description.png)

If it's not available, you can use AI to describe the website.

### 5. Find the Icon

Use `favicon.ico` if there are no icons available, but try to find a high-resolution icons first. If multiple icons are available, choose one that is similar to the favicon used. Some websites may not have an icon; you can leave it blank. Store icons in the relevant folder inside `/public/resources/`.

```text
/ca-resources/
  â””â”€ public
    â””â”€ resources
      â””â”€ colors
      â””â”€ icons
      â””â”€ inspirations
      â””â”€ learnwebdev
      â””â”€ mockups
      â””â”€ stock-photos
      â””â”€ typography
```

#### Example Submission

```typescript
{
  title: "MDN Web Docs",
  url: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/",
  description: "Provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs.",
  iconPath: "/resources/learnwebdev/mdn.png"
}
```
