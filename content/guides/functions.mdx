title: Functions
description: Functions are a fundamental part of JavaScript. They are used to perform operations on pieces of text, to change the HTML content, and to change HTML styles and attributes.

JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword. You can use a function declaration or a function expression. A function in JavaScript is similar to a **mathematical function**. A **mathematical function** takes in **arguments**, **executes computation**, and **produces results**. 

For example, the `sin(x)` mathematical function receives the `x` argument, calculates the `sin` of the given `x` angle, and returns the calculated `sin of x`. Likewise, a JavaScript function might **receive arguments**, that will perform a calculation, and might return an answer. 

Here’s the syntax for calling a function:

```plaintext
function function-name(zero-or-more-parameters-separated-by-commas)
```

As shown in the code below, we have a source code for Hello web page button that has `onclick` attribute with a value of `displayHello();`. That's JavaScript function call, and its syntax matches the preceding syntax. Note the parenthesis are empty because there's no need to pass any argument values to the `displayHello` function. If there were arguments, they would need to be separated by commas, and proper style suggests that you insert a space after each comma.

### Source code for Hello World web page

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function displayHello() {
        var msg;
        msg = document.getElementById('message');
        msg.outerHTML = "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3 id="message">
      To see the traditional first program greeting, click below.
    </h3>
    <input type="button" value="Click Me!" onclick="displayHello();">
  </body>
</html>
```

When you save the code above in an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in a web browser. When you click the **button**, in the text "To see the traditional first program greeting, click below." It will be replaced with "**Hello world!**" in an `<h1>` element.

### Display Function code

<Tabs items={['syntax', 'displayHello.js']}>
<Tab value="syntax">
Here’s the syntax for a function definition:

```plaintext
function function-name(zero-or-more-parameters-separated-by-commas) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  last-statement;
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="displayHello.js">

```js
function displayHello() {
  var msg;
  msg = document.getElementById('message');
  msg.outerHTML = "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `displayHello` function is defined to find the element with the **ID message** and change its `outerHTML` to display an `<h1>` element with the text "**Hello world!**". While the button is the `<input>` element creates a button on the web page with the value "**Click Me!**" and an `onclick` attribute that calls the `displayHello` function when the button is clicked.

It is seen as the `displayHello` function definition that follows the prior syntax. The parentheses in the function heading are empty because the function call’s parentheses are empty (the function call was `displayHello();`). If there are arguments in the function call, then you’ll normally have the same number of parameters in the function heading—one parameter to receive each argument’s value.

Note how we’re using the term **argument** for the values in a function call’s parentheses and the term **parameter** for the associated words in a function definition heading’s parenthesis. Some people use the term argument for both, but to make it easier to distinguish between the **function call** and the **function definition**, we’ll stick with the separate formal names—argument and parameter.

Normally, function definitions should be placed (**1**) in a `script` container in the web page’s head container or (**2**) in an external JavaScript file. Go back to the Hello web page code above and verify that the `displayHello` function definition is in a script container. You’ll want to use an external JavaScript file if you have lots of JavaScript code. We’ll show a web page that uses an external JavaScript file later in the book.

The line `msg = document.getElementById('message');` is used to find and assign a reference to an HTML element with the specified ID (message) to the variable msg. A document is a global object representing the HTML document currently displayed in the browser. Another is `getElementById('message')`, a document object method. It searches the document for an element with the ID attribute value '**message**' and then returns that kind of element.

Looking back to the previous code, you can see three lines in the function’s body. Each line is a JavaScript statement, where a statement performs a task. As you can see in the code above, we have three statements that end with a semicolon. Semicolons are required at the end of a JavaScript statement only if the JavaScript statement is followed by another JavaScript statement, so it would have been legal to omit the semicolon after the last statement.

However, coding conventions dictate that you terminate every statement with a semicolon, even the last one. Why? Suppose there’s no semicolon at the end of the last statement and someone later adds a new statement after the last statement. That creates a bug if they forget to insert a semicolon between the two statements. Another reason to insert a semicolon after the last statement is that if you don’t do it, the JavaScript engine does it for you behind the scenes, and that slows things down slightly.
