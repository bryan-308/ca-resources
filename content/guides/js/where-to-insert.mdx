### JavaScript can be placed in the head and body section

We can place JavaScript both in the `<head>` and `<body>` sections of a page by using the `<script></script>` elements.

### JavaScript in the head section

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed!";
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>
    <p id="demo">A paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript in the body section
```html {7-11} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Demo JavaScript in Body</h2>
    <p id="demo">A paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed!";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript can be external from the HTML file
- JavaScript can also be placed in external files just like external CSS.
- External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
- JavaScript files have the file extension of `.js`.
- To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the **src** (source) attribute of a `<script>` tag.
- Users can place an external script reference in `<head>` or `<body>`. The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the `<script>` tag is located.

<Callout>
External JavaScript cannot contain `<script>` tags.

The use of `<script>` tag will be inside the html file.
</Callout>

### Connecting to external JavaScript
```js
// js/myScript.js
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
```
```html {9} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Demo External JavaScript</h2>
    <p id="demo">A paragraph.</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    <p>This exmaple links to "myScript.js"</p>
    <p>(myFunction is stored in "myScript.js")</p>
    <script src="js/myScript.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Advantages of using external JavaScript
- Placing scripts in external files offer some advantages like:
  - It separates HTML tags and JavaScript code.
  - It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.
  - Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.

### External References
- An external references can be referenced in 3 different ways.
  - With a full URL **website link**.
  - With a file path `/js/javascript.js`
  - With any path `javascript.js`

## General Rules in Writing JavaScript
- Semicolons (;) are used to separate JavaScript statement therefore, every statement should have a semicolon at the end. 
  ```js
  document.write("Hello everyone");
  ```
- Multiple statements can be allowed to be written in one line when separated by semicolons.
  ```js
  a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
  ```
- JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. Users can add white space to the script to make it more readable.
  ```js
  let person="Max";
  
  // is the same as
  let person = "Max";
  ```
- A good practice is to put spaces around operators `(= + - * /)`.
  ```js
  let x = y + z;
  ```
- We can use the `+` symbol for concatenation.
  ```js
  window.alert("My age is " + 12);
  ```
- We can insert HTML codes in JavaScript outputs.
  ```js
  document.write("<h1>Hello</h1>");
  ```
- JavaScript code can be grouped together in blocks by placing them inside curly brackets.
  ```js
  function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello everyone!";
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
  }
  ```

## Displaying output using JavaScript
- JavaScript can display data using different ways. 
  - Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.
  - Writing into an HTML output, using `document.write()`.
  - Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.

### Using innerHTML
- To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the `document.getElementById(id)` method.
- The **id** attribute defines the HTML element where the method will be implemented.
- The **innerHTML** property defines the HTML content that is visible within the page.
- Changing the **innerHTML** property of an HTML element is the most common way to display data in HTML using JavaScript.

```html {8} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Using innerHTML</h2>
    <p>My First Paragraph.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My Second Paragraph";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Using `document.write`
- Another way to display output on the HTML page is to use the `document.write()` method.
- Document.write is only recommended for testing purposes. When deployed for actual use, using the `document.write()` after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
```html {7} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Using innerHTML</h2>
    <p>My First Paragraph.</p>
    <script>
      document.write("My Second Paragraph");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Using `window.alert`
- Using `window.alert()` activates an alert box that will display the user data on the web page.
```html {7} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Using innerHTML</h2>
    <p>My First Paragraph.</p>
    <script>
      window.alert("This is an alert box!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## JavaScript comments
- JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
- JavaScript comments can be used to prevent code execution, when testing alternative code.
- We can use **single line** and **multi-line** comments in JavaScript.
- **Single line** comments are the most often used method of placing comments, **multi-line** or **block** comments are used when documenting the project.

#### Single Line Comment
```html {7, 9} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    <p id="myP"></p>
    <script>
      // Change content of heading:
      document.getElementById("myH") = "JavaScript Comments";
      // Change content of paragraph:
      document.getElementById("myP") = "My First Paragraph";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Multi-line Comment
```html {7-11} 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    <p id="myP"></p>
    <script>
      /*
        The code below will change 
        the heading with id = "myH"
        and the paragraph with id = "myP"
      */
      document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
      document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My First Paragraph";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
