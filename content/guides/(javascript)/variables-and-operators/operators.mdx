description: Overview of JavaScript operators, including types and examples of arithmetic operations.

JavaScript includes operators same as other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example, in 1 + 2, the + sign is an operator and 1 is left side operand and 2 is right side operand. The + operator performs the addition of two numeric values and returns a result.

## Types of JavaScript Operators

There are different types of JavaScript operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric operands.

| Operator | Description                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| +        | Adds two numeric operands.                          |
| -        | Subtract right operand from left operand.           |
| *        | Multiply two numeric operands.                      |
| /        | Divide left operand by right operand.               |
| %        | Modulus operator, Returns remainder of two operands.|
| ++       | Increment operator. Increase operand value by one.  |
| --       | Decrement operator. Decrease value by one.          |

The following example demonstrates how arithmetic operators perform different tasks on operands.

```js
let x = 5, y = 10;

let z = x + y; // performs addition and returns 15

z = x - y;    // performs subtraction and returns -5

z = x * y;    // performs multiplication and returns 50

z = x / y;    // performs division and returns 0.5

z = x % 2;    // performs division remainder 1
```

### Operator Precedence

- Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in arithmetic expressions
- Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). (**MDAS** Rule)
- We can change the precedence by using parentheses ()

**Example**:
  - (100 + 50) * 3;
  - The program will compute for the sum of 100 and 5 first before multiplying it by 3.

### Assignment Operator

JavaScript provides the assignment operators to assign values to variables with less keystrokes.

| Assignment Operator | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =                   | Assigns right operand value to the left operand.                                                        |
| +=                  | Sums up left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.                        |
| -=                  | Subtract right operand value from the left operand value and assign the result to the left operand.     |
| *=                  | Multiply left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.                      |
| /=                  | Divide left operand value by right operand value and assigns the result to the left operand.            |
| %=                  | Get the modulus of left operand divide by right operand and assign resulted modulus to the left operand.|

```js
let x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;

x = y; // x would be 10

x += 1; // x would be 6

x -= 1; // x would be 4

x *= 5; // x would be 25

x /= 5; // x would be 1

x &= 2; // x would be 1
```

The addition assignment operator (**+=**) adds a value to a variable.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>JavaScript Arithmetic</h1>
    <h2>The += Operator</h2>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      var x = 10;
      x += 5;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The addition assignment operator (**+=**) can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Combining Strings</h1>
    <h2>The += Operator</h2>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      let message = "It is ";
      message += "a beautiful day!";
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = message;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Comparison Operators

JavaScript provides comparison operators that compare two operands and return a boolean value true or false.

| Operators | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ==        | Compares the equality of two operands without considering type.                                                                 |
| ===       | Compares equality of two operands with type.                                                                                    |
| !=        | Compares of inequality of two operands.                                                                                         |
| &gt;      | Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is greater than right-side value; otherwise, returns false.                 |
| &lt;      | Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is less than right-side value; otherwise, returns false.                    |
| >=        | Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is greater than or equal to the right-side value; otherwise, returns false. |
| &lt;=     | Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is less than or equal to the right-side value; otherwise, returns false.    |

The following example demonstrates the comparison operators.

```js
let a = 5, b = 10, c = "5";
let x = a;

a == c; // returns true

a === c; // returns false

a == x; // returns true

a != b; // returns true 

a > b; // returns false

a < b; // returns true

a >= b; // returns false

a <= b; // returns true

```

### Logical Operators

In JavaScript, the logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. JavaScript provides the following logical operators.

| Operator | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| &&       | && is known as AND operator. It checks whether two operands are non-zero or not (0, false, undefined, null or "" are considered as zero). It returns 1 if they are non-zero; otherwise, returns 0.                   |
| &#124;&#124; | &#124;&#124; is known as OR operator. It checks whether any one of the operands is non-zero or not (0, false, undefined, null or "" are considered as zero). It returns 1 if any one of them is non-zero; otherwise, returns 0.|
| !        | ! is known as NOT operator. It reverses the boolean result of the operand (or condition). `!false` returns `true`, and `!true` returns `false`.                                                                      |

The following example demonstrates the logical operators.

```js
let a = 5, b = 10;

(a != b) && (a < b);  // returns true

(a > b) || (a == b);  // returns false

(a < b) || (a == b);  // returns true

!(a < b);             // returns false

!(a > b);             // returns true
```
