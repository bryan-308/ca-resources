description: Brief history of JavaScript
---

JavaScript has evolved significantly since its introduction in 1995, transitioning from a client-side scripting language to a versatile programming language capable of operating across the entire software stack. It has become a crucial component in modern web applications, playing a prominent role in web services and applications. In 1995, the dominant browser manufacturer was Netscape, and one of its employees, Brendan Eich, thought that it would be useful to add dynamic functionality to web pages. So he designed the JavaScript programming language, which adds dynamic functionality to web pages when used in conjunction with HTML.

It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity. Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB use JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

Furthermore, JavaScript has transformed from a basic client-side scripting language to a powerful and versatile programming language that underpins a significant portion of modern web development. Its influence on web technologies, package management, and software development practices highlights the necessity for ongoing research and analysis to adapt to its evolving ecosystem. JavaScript is a programming language, but it's more powerful than the HTML programming language. For the most part, HTML just enables you (the programmer) to display stuff on your web page. JavaScript adds quite a bit of functionality by enabling you to read user input and update what the web page displays.
