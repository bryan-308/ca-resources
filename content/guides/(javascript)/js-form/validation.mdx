## Form Validation: Server-side and Client-side

Forms are essential part of web development that is used to collect user inputs and then interact with web servers. It also allows users to submit different types of information to process and store and is typically used for different actions such as registration, login, search queries, and data entry. Forms also enable users to interact and transmit data on websites. It will systematically collect and then track the inputs of the user, but also provide a variety of controls and attributes to hold different types of data and ensure a seamless user experience.

Correct implementation and validation of forms are critical for both usability and security. It is important to validate the form submitted by the user because it can have inappropriate values. So, validation is a must to authenticate the user. JavaScript provides the facility to validate the form on the client side so data processing will be faster than server-side validation. Most web developers prefer JavaScript form validation.

There are two basic strategies for processing a form’s input data. The process may occur on the **client side** (on the browser’s computer) it is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server or on the **server side** (on the web server’s computer). It is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server. With server-side processing, the form input values are transmitted across the Internet to the server computer.

The server then does the processes and transmits the answers back to the client computer. The answers are in the form of a new web page or an updated version of the original web page. With client-side processing, there’s no need to go back and forth across the Internet with user input and generated results. After the web page downloads, the client computer does all the work. Therefore, client-side processing tends to be faster. So normally, you should use client-side processing for relatively simple web pages.
