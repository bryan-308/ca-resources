## General Rules in Writing JavaScript

Semicolons (;) are used to separate JavaScript statement therefore, every statement should have a semicolon at the end. 
```js
document.write("Hello everyone");
```

Multiple statements can be allowed to be written in one line when separated by semicolons.
```js
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
```

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. Users can add white space to the script to make it more readable.
```js
let person="Max";

// is the same as
let person = "Max";
```

A good practice is to put spaces around operators `(= + - * /)`.
```js
let x = y + z;
```

We can use the `+` symbol for concatenation.
```js
window.alert("My age is " + 12);
```

We can insert HTML codes in JavaScript outputs.
```js
document.write("<h1>Hello</h1>");
```

JavaScript code can be grouped together in blocks by placing them inside curly brackets.
```js
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello everyone!";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
```
