### What is HTML Form?
HTML **forms** are a fundamental part of web development, enabling user interaction with web pages. They are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. **Forms** are essential for various web applications, such as login pages, registration forms, search boxes, and online surveys. The feedback of the user is mostly submitted to a server for review. **Form processing** is often called **client/server processing** because it requires both a client (a browser) and a remote server.

### HTML Form Example

<Wrapper className="w-fit" variant="gradient">

<LoginForm />

</Wrapper>

### Form Element

The HTML `<form>` and `</form>` tag pairs define a form that can be used to collect user input.

An HTML form contains different form elements.

Form elements are different types of input elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons and more.

### Form attributes

The **action** attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

```html
// [!code word:action]
<form action=""></form>
```

The **method** attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

<Tabs items={['post', 'get']}>
<Tab value="post">
```html
// [!code word:post]
<form method="post"></form>
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="get">
```html
// [!code word:get]
<form method="get"></form>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
The **form-data** can be sent as URL variables (with `method="get"`) or as HTTP POST transaction (with `method="post"`).

See [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_method.asp) for more information about **post** and **get** method.
