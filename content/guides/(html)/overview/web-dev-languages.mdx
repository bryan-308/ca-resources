### HyperText Markup Language

**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

### Cascading Style Sheets

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

### How Can We Apply CSS to a Web Page?

#### Inline CSS

**Inline CSS** is used for applying style to a particular HTML Tag. The style attribute is used to style a particular HTML Tag. Least recommended styling method because of the difficulty it brings in managing larger websites. Useful for testing and previewing changes.

#### Internal CSS

**Internal CSS** code is put in the `<head>` section of a particular web page. **Classes** and **IDs** can be used to refer to the CSS code Style will be effective for the whole web page. Internal CSS is put in between `<style> </style>` tags.

#### External CSS

**External CSS** is the most convenient way to add CSS to a website. Only a single CSS file will be edited and all web pages will be updated. Provides smaller web page sizes and cleaner structure.

#### CSS Framework

A **CSS Framework** is a pre-prepared software framework that is meant to allow for easier, more standards compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets Language.
