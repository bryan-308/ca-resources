<Steps>

<Step>

### Planning

**Objective**: Define the purpose, goals, and scope of the project.

**Activities**:
- Identify project stakeholders and their requirements.
- Define project timelines and milestones.
- Develop a budget and allocate resources.
- Conduct a feasibility study.

</Step>
<Step>

### Analysis

**Objective**: Understand and document the detailed requirements of the project.

**Activities**:
- Gather information about user needs and expectations.
- Create user personas and use cases.
- Analyze the existing systems (if any) and determine the
- necessary features and functionalities for the new system.

</Step>
<Step>

### Design

**Objective**: Create a blueprint for the web application based on the gathered requirements.

**Activities**:
- Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
- Create wireframes and prototypes.
- Define the system architecture and database structure.
- Plan for security measures.

</Step>
<Step>

### Development

**Objective**: Transform the design into actual code and build a functional web application.

**Activities**:
- Write code using programming languages and frameworks.
- Develop the database and integrate it with the application.
- Implement the designed UI/UX.

</Step>
<Step>

### Testing

**Objective**: Ensure the quality and functionality

**Activities**:
- Perform unit testing to check individual components.
- Conduct integration testing to verify interactions between components.
- Carry out system testing to evaluate the entire application.
- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

</Step>
<Step>

### Implementation

**Objective**: Deploy the web application to the production environment.

**Activities**:
- Set up hosting and configure servers.
- Transfer the codebase and database to the production environment.
- Monitor and address any issues during the deployment process.

</Step>
<Step>

### Maintenance

**Objective**: Sustain and improve the web application over time.

**Activities**:
- Provide ongoing support and troubleshooting.
- Make updates and enhancements based on user feedback.
- Monitor performance and security.
- Address bugs and apply patches as needed.

</Step>
