## File Path Where the Resources are Stored

The resources are stored in the `resources.ts` file located at:

<Files>
<Folder name="data" defaultOpen>

<File name="resources.ts" />

</Folder>
</Files>

```typescript title="resources.ts"
page: { // object key as the resource path
  title: "",
  // ...
  resourcesList: [
    {
      title: "", // Title of the resources category (optional)
      links: [
        {
          title: "", // Title of the specific link
          url: "",
          description: "",
          iconPath: "",
        }

## Steps to Gather Resource Information

<Steps>

<Step>

### Use Desktop/Laptop

It is recommended to use a desktop or laptop for ease of gathering information by inspecting website elements. Open the website you want to add.

</Step>

<Step>

### Gather Title

Using developer tools, inspect the websiteâ€™s `<title>` element inside the `<head>` tag and copy the text to use as the resource title.

</Step>

<Step>

### Get the URL

Copy the main website URL; if the webpage is a subpage, it's okay to use it as long as it directs users to the main webpage.

</Step>

<Step>

### Get the Description

Look for the `<meta name="description" content="...">` tag in the `<head>` section. Copy the `content` attribute's value as the description.

If it's not available, you can use AI to describe the website.

</Step>

<Step>

### Find the Icon

Use `favicon.ico` if there are no icons available, but try to find a high-resolution icons first. If multiple icons are available, choose one that is similar to the favicon used. Some websites may not have an icon; you can leave it blank. Store icons in the relevant folder inside `/public/resources/`.

<Files>
<Folder name="public" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="colors">
  <File name="coolors.png" />
</Folder>

<Folder name="icons">
  <File name="svgmix.png" />
</Folder>

<Folder name="learnwebdev">
  <File name="mdn.png" />
</Folder>

</Folder>

</Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

</Steps>

### Example Submission

```typescript
{
  title: "MDN Web Docs",
  url: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/",
  description: "Provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs.",
  iconPath: "/resources/learnwebdev/mdn.png"
