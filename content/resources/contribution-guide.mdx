## File Path Where the Resources are Stored

The resources are stored in the `resources.ts` file located at:

<Files>

<Folder name="root-folder" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="data" defaultOpen>

<File name="resources.ts" />

</Folder>

</Folder>

</Files>

```typescript title="resources.ts"
page: { // object key as the resource path
  title: "",
  // ...
  resourcesList: [
    {
      title: "", // Title of the resources category (optional)
      links: [
        {
          title: "", // Title of the specific link
          url: "",

## Steps to Gather Resource Information

<Steps>

<Step>

### Use Desktop/Laptop

It is recommended to use a desktop or laptop for ease of gathering information by inspecting website elements. Open the website you want to add.

</Step>

<Step>

### Gather Title

Using developer tools, inspect the websiteâ€™s `<title>` element inside the `<head>` tag and copy the text to use as the resource title.

<ImageSection 
  src="/contribution-images/gather-title.png"
  alt="gather title"
  width={580}
  height={333} 
  subtitle="gather title"
/>

</Step>

<Step>

### Get the URL

Copy the main website URL. If the webpage is a subpage, it's acceptable to use it as long as it directs users to the main webpage where the resource is located.

</Step>

<Step>

### Get the Description

Look for the `<meta name="description" content="...">` tag in the `<head>` section. Copy the `content` attribute's value as the description.

<ImageSection 
  src="/contribution-images/gather-description.png"
  alt="gather description"
  width={576}
  height={334}
  subtitle="gather description"
/>

If it's not available, you can use AI to describe the website.

</Step>

<Step>

### Find the Icon

Use `favicon.ico` if there are no icons available, but try to find a high-resolution icons first. If multiple icons are available, choose one that is similar to the favicon used. Some websites may not have an icon; you can leave it blank. Store icons in the relevant folder inside `/public/resources/`.

<Files>
<Folder name="public" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="colors">
  <File name="coolors.png" />
</Folder>

<Folder name="icons">
  <File name="svgmix.png" />
</Folder>

<Folder name="learnwebdev">
  <File name="mdn.png" />
</Folder>

</Folder>

</Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

</Steps>

### Example Submission

```typescript
{
  title: "MDN Web Docs",
  url: "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/",
  description: "Provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs.",
  iconPath: "/resources/learnwebdev/mdn.png"
}
```

## Adding a New Resource Page

If you want to add a new resource page, follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a New Folder

Create a new folder inside `/public/resources/` with the name of the resource category. For example, if you are adding a new resource for "File Converters", create a folder named `file-converters` to insert the icons.

<Files>
<Folder name="public" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="file-converters">
  <File name="convertio.png" />
</Folder>

</Folder>

</Folder>
</Files>

</Step>

<Step>

### Update `resources.ts`

Create a new object inside `resourcesData` with the title of the resource category and an array of links to individual resources.

```typescript title="resources.ts"
// For example I want to add a new resource page for 'file converters'
fileconverters: {
  title: "File Converters",
  resourcesList: [
    {
      title: "Online File Converter", // optional, include only if there is another category within the resource page
      links: [
        {
          title: "Convertio",
          url: "https://convertio.co/",
          description: "An easy tool to convert files online.",
          iconPath: "/resources/file-converters/convertio.png"
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
},
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a New Content File

Create a new file in the `contents` folder to ensure the added resource is displayed on the page. Name the file appropriately to reflect the resource category or specific resource you are adding.

<Files>
<Folder name="contents" defaultOpen>

<Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>

<File name="file-converters.mdx" />

</Folder>

</Folder>
</Files>

```mdx title="file-converters.mdx"
---
title: File Converters
description: Discover online tools to convert files easily and efficiently.
---

<ResourcesCards type="fileconverters" />
```

And you are good to go! ðŸŽ‰
